# ML-for-Intrusion-Detection
## Project Overview
This project aims to build a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that can automatically detect and classify malicious network traffic. Traditional security systems often struggle with new and evolving threats ‚Äî machine learning provides a powerful approach to identifying both known and unknown attacks based on network flow features.

## üöÄ Key Features
Preprocessing and cleaning of network flow data
Feature selection and engineering for better model performance
Training multiple ML models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, KNN, Neural Networks)
Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC
(Optional) Future enhancements: Deep Learning models (LSTM/CNN), real-time detection, and CUDA acceleration

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
PyTorch / TensorFlow 
Git and GitHub for version control
